1. User Authentication and Authorization
Users: Different user roles could include:
  Admin: Full access to the system (can add/edit/delete listings, manage users, etc.).
  Agent: Can add and manage their own property listings.
  Customer/Visitor: Can browse and search listings but may need to register or log in to make inquiries or save favorites.

2. Property Listings
Properties: Each listing would have detailed information, such as:
  Property type (apartment, house, land, etc.)
  Location (address, city, zip code, map)
  Price
  Photos
  Descriptions (including number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.)
  Features (e.g., parking, garden, balcony)
Search and Filters: Users should be able to search and filter properties by location, price range, property type, and other characteristics.
  Example Filters: Price range, number of bedrooms, amenities, proximity to certain locations (schools, parks, etc.).

3. Property Management
CRUD Operations for listings:
  Admins and agents should be able to create, read, update, and delete listings.
  You could implement soft deletes where listings are not permanently removed but rather hidden from public view.
Listing Expiry: Set an expiration for property listings, and once expired, remove or archive them. You could add this as part of the listing creation process.

4. Multimedia Support
  Images: Support for uploading multiple images for each listing, allowing users to view properties in a gallery format.
  Videos: Add support for video walkthroughs or virtual tours.

5. User Interaction
  Inquiries/Contacting Agent: Allow customers to inquire about a property directly through the app (e.g., contact form, phone number, email).
  Favorites: Let users save their favorite listings for easy access later.
  Messaging System: A simple chat/messaging system between customers and agents for direct communication.

6. Admin Dashboard
Analytics: Admins could have access to a dashboard where they can track:
  Number of new listings
  User engagement (e.g., inquiries, favorites)
  Revenue (if charging agents for listings, etc.)
User Management: Admins should be able to view, edit, and delete user accounts (agents, customers).

7. Payment Integration (Optional)
If you want to monetize your platform, consider adding:
  Subscription model: Charge agents for premium listings or added visibility.
  Payment gateway integration: Allow agents to pay for listing visibility via a payment system (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

8. Geolocation and Mapping
  Google Maps Integration: Display properties on a map for better visualization of the location.
  Address Auto-Complete: Help users enter addresses quickly with suggestions as they type (using Google Places API or similar services).

9. Mobile Responsiveness
  Ensure that the platform is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
  Mobile Apps: Eventually, if you want to take it a step further, consider developing mobile apps for both Android and iOS.
